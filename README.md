This project implements a deep learning-based approach to detect brain tumours from MRI images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model classifies images into two categories: Tumour and No Tumour.

Features : 
Data loading and visualization
Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
CNN model building using Keras
Training and validation
Performance evaluation (accuracy, loss)
Sample predictions on test data
